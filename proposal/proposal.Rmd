# Introduction
The second world war ended in 1945 with two nuclear explosion in Japan, Nagasaki and Hiroshima. After that situation, the importance of nuclear power was understood by allied powers that were able to be named as winners of the second world war. After that war, the cold war began. Old allies became new enemies. In order to win the arms race, two enemies started developing nuclear weapons and tested them in deserts, oceans, islands and etc. Different explosion methods, different nuclear energy sources were used in order to find perfect way to create the perfect Armageddon weapon. Luckily, there has been no usage of nuclear power to destroy a nation. However, as I have said before, these weapons were tested and these tests have harmed our environment in a very bad way
